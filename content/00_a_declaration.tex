I have used some help of a generative AI tool to write this paper. However, the use of the AI
tool has been strictly limited to the generation of ideas for sentence completion, aiding at properly
paraphrasing cited sources, rewriting sentences for better readability, avoiding grammatical errors,
and writing boilerplate \LaTeX\ code. Any generated content has been manually and diligently reviewed
and edited by the author to conform to the standards of scholarly communication, and to conceptually
fit into the paper and the narrative.
