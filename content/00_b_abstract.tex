\section*{Abstract / Summary}

This paper explores strategic business innovation in the context of career counseling. Using
the latest generation of AI technology, we develop a new business model that we term
\textit{Career-Counseling-as-a-Service} (CCaaS). The main innovation of CCaaS is the use of AI-powered
tools that are provided as a service to other stakeholders in the digital ecosystem surrounding
the most powerful player in terms of users' employment, education and skills data, i.e., LinkedIn.
We show that the business model can be implemented as a customer-centric innovation that fits the
customer perspective, such as the need for highly personalized services and more affordable services.
CCaaS enables and fosters the generation of more customer value through the co-creation of value
as part of a value-network with career counselors, counseling companies, start-ups, and LinkedIn
at its center. A multi-angled assessment of the business model shows that the business model
is viable, that the innovation is technologically feasible, that risks are manageable and can
be mitigated. Finally, using the System-FIT analysis, we show that the innovation fits in
a new and unique emerging digital ecosystem of AI-powered career counseling that is controlled
by LinkedIn.
