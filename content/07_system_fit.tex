\section{System-FIT}
\label{sec:system_fit}

System-FIT is a framework introduced by \citet{griederDigitalEcosystemHow2019,schwafertsDigitalBusinessDevelopment2020}
and helps companies to evaluate the fit of their business model with an existing or emerging digital ecosystem.
In particular, \cite{schwafertsDigitalBusinessDevelopment2020} argues that most companies are not able
to create their own digital ecosystem and therefore have to join an existing one. The framework
thus helps companies navigate, evaluate and choose the right digital ecosystem to join. 
Further, to be successful in the digital age, companies need to join a digital ecosystem where they can contribute 
to the value co-creation based on their uniqueness \citep{griederDigitalEcosystemHow2019}.
In particular, this thinking allows for companies to \textit{``decouple themselves from the traditional thinking of
company boundaries''} \citep[p.~42]{griederDigitalEcosystemHow2019}.
In the case of career counseling, we have seen in Subsection \ref{subsec:ecosystem} that it
does not meet the definition of a true ecosystem yet. LinkedIn can introduce the CCaaS model to 
create a new digital ecosystem for career counseling as a value co-creation network with LinkedIn
as the most powerful company, i.e., the company of reference at its center. In the following we will thus evaluate
the fit of CCaaS as a transformative business model in the emerging digital ecosystem of AI-based career counseling
using System-FIT. System-FIT was presented uses 5 dimensions to assess the fit of a business model in a digital ecosystem.
The 5 dimensions include \textit{FIT of uniqueness}, \textit{FIT of management}, \textit{FIT of structure}, \textit{FIT of
partnering} and \textit{FIT of customer understanding} are presented in Figure \ref{fig:system_fit}.

\subsection{Fit of Uniqueness}

Fit of uniqueness is the understanding of a companies own contribution to the ecosystem, and how it is unique
and cannot be easily replaced---or the value contributed---by competitors \citep[p.~53]{griederDigitalEcosystemHow2019}.
The more unique a company's contribution is, the more it is powerful to influence the ecosystem. The uniqueness of a company's
contribution in a digital ecosystem is determined by its ability to orchestrate the key activities and key resources 
that are required to create a value proposition in the ecosystem \citep[p.~201]{schwafertsLectureStrategicBusiness2023}.
CCaaS is a transformative business model that will create a \textit{new} digital ecosystem for
AI-powered career counseling. The uniqueness of CCaaS is mostly determined by access to data and 
access to machine learning technology. Because LinkedIn is in a ``power play'' position in terms 
of breadth and granularity of employee data, as well as the access to the most advanced AI technology 
through its parent company Microsoft and OpenAI, which Microsoft also invested in.

The key activities of CCaaS are the development and operation of the CCaaS API layer, the development
of the AI-based career counseling algorithms, and the development of the career counseling client
application. The key resources are the data that is required to train the AI-based career counseling
algorithms, the AI technology and the computing resources that are required to run the algorithms and
the CCaaS API layer. The key activities (training AI models) and key resources (large and granular 
database of employee data) are unique to LinkedIn and cannot be easily replaced by another company.
The uniqueness of LinkedIn as a main player in the ecosystem is thus very high.
For these same reasons, LinkedIn is also the most powerful company in this emerging digital ecosystem.
LinkedIn is needed as the central actor and provider of the CCaaS API platform. It is unlikely that any
other company will be able to create this ecosystem. The need of LinkedIn is thus absolutely essential.

The uniqueness of the CCaaS model by LinkedIn is limited geographically. While LinkedIn is a global
company, the CCaaS model will only be available in countries where LinkedIn is available and where 
LinkedIn has sufficient user data. Thus, it may happen that another large player appears in other 
markets, such as China and Russia. However, LinkedIn is already the largest professional network in
the world and has a strong brand. It is thus unlikely that another company will be able to compete
with LinkedIn in the foreseeable future in this digital ecosystem. The uniqueness of the contribution 
of the CCaaS model is thus very high and LinkedIn as its central actor is confirmed.

\subsection{Fit of Management}

In the emerging digital ecosystem of AI-based career counseling, LinkedIn is the most powerful company.
LinkedIn is also the orchestrator of the ecosystem via its CCaaS model. Thus, LinkedIn has the power 
to establish the rules of the ecosystem and to steer the direction of development of the ecosystem. In 
particular, LinkedIn can exclude other actors from the CCaaS API layer thereby limiting their ability
to provide good counseling and recommendations to their clients. 

However, the management of LinkedIn should consider the other actors in the digital ecosystem and their needs.
In particular, the needs and pains of career counselors and clients need to be integrated into the decision-making
processes. As argued previously, the CCaaS model relies on value co-creation and thus requires strong 
partners that are enabled to innovate via the CCaaS API layer. This form of open innovation will also 
benefit LinkedIn through increased usage of the CCaaS API that will lead to higher revenues and more
feedback data. LinkedIn thus has to act as the orchestrator of the emerging digital ecosystem and
ensure proper governance (such as same access and pricing conditions for all players). This will build
multilateral trust, lead to alignment of the ecosystem actors and ultimately facilitate and accelerate
the joint value-creation. With a steadily increasing workforce with tertiary education in the Western
world, the demand for counseling services will continue to grow. The digital ecosystem will thus 
provide plenty of opportunities for many actors to co-create value and grow together.


\subsection{Fit of Structure}

The (infra-)structure of the digital ecosystem does not exist yet as such. However, LinkedIn has the
data and access to the computation and AI technology resources via its parent company Microsoft. As
introduced in subsection \ref{subsec:system_architecture}, the system architecture of CCaaS is based 
on a microservice architecture. This allows for a modular and flexible system structure that can be
easily adapted to the needs of the ecosystem actors as well as to evolving needs: new microservices 
may easily be added while microservices that are no longer needed could be retired. Of course---referring 
back to Fit of Management---LinkedIn has to be cautious in taking decisions to retire microservices 
and consider the needs of the ecosystem actors. The CCaaS API layer should be kept as stable as possible
and backward-compatible to ensure that the ecosystem actors can rely on it. Any changes to the API 
or removing of services have to be planned well in advance and communicated to the ecosystem actors
to give them enough time to adapt. Ideally the CCaaS API layer will be extended over time to provide
more functionality and thus enable the ecosystem actors to innovate and create more value. Through
the API-based architecture, other actors in the ecosystem are empowered to customize their own offerings.


\subsection{Fit of Partnering}

The new and emerging digital ecosystem of AI-based career counseling is based on the CCaaS model
that fully relies on value co-creation. The ecosystem actors are thus partners and each contribute
to the value that is created for the counseling clients. Using feedback data from the counselors and
clients, the value proposition can be enhanced, and the ecosystem actors can further improve their
offerings: the sum of co-created value thereby surpasses the value creation that each actor could
achieve on its own. The ecosystem actors are thus interdependent and rely on each other. Using a
human in the loop approach as a fundamental ethical value, LinkedIn and career counselors can align
on the ultimate goal of providing the best possible career outcomes for the counseling clients,
without LinkedIn threatening the jobs of the career counselors through automation. The emerging
digital ecosystem will thus be very stable as LinkedIn will be the uncontested central actor, all 
while being dependent on counselors, e.g., to provide local physical presence. The ecosystem actors
will thus be able to rely on the ecosystem and invest in their offerings. The CCaaS model will also
allow for a high degree of customization and thus enable the ecosystem actors to differentiate their
offerings. The pricing of the API is fair and transparent, although limited competition between
different career counselors could arise. However, this competition is likely to improve the quality
of the offerings and/or drive down the costs for the counseling clients. 


\subsection{Fit of Customer Understanding}

LinkedIn's CCaaS offering is fully complementary to existing career counselors' services. The CCaaS
addresses pains and potential gains of counseling clients that the counselors alone cannot tackle 
(such as providing affordable career advice, more personalized coaching, and reducing risks 
in career transitions through better AI-based insights on LinkedIn's data). The CCaaS acts in the
best interest and according to the expectations of counseling clients, which will lead to a high
degree of customer satisfaction.
