\section{Drivers}
\label{sec:drivers}

Drivers are the set of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators that ultimately drive the behavior of our customers.
These are the deeply-rooted, sometimes unconscious, causes and the true source of the customer's needs. Understanding
these drivers can help us to conceptualize innovative solutions and business models that are more likely to succeed due
to the customer-centricity and acceptance.
