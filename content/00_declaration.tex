\noindent The author has used the help of generative AI tools, in particular GitHub Copilot, to
write this paper. However, the use of AI tools has been limited to the generation of ideas for
writing, paraphrasing cited sources, rewriting sentences for better readability, avoiding grammatical
errors, and writing boilerplate \LaTeX\ code. Any generated content has been manually and diligently
reviewed and edited by the author to conform to the standards of scholarly communication, and to
conceptually fit into the paper and the narrative.
